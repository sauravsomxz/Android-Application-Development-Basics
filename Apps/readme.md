1. Text View - Text View as the name suggests is the widget which is used to display text on the screen. Only to display text. 

2. Button Functionality - Here, I've used two input fields - Plain Text (widget) for username and Password (widget) for password. Then in the main activity, I've created a func that willl take input and when the button (Log In) will be clicked, then the values from the username and password will be displayed in the "Logcat" or "Run". 

3. Toast Functionality - Toast is a function in java where whatever you type in the text field/if you want your app to have a simple welcome message. It will display it back to the user when that function is called. So in this application I've made a simple UI where the app is asking for the name of the user and says, "Hey There" + name-of-the-user+"!".
