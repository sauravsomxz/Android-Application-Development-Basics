1. Text View - Text View as the name suggests is the widget which is used to display text on the screen. Only to display text. 

2. Button Functionality - Here, I've used two input fields - Plain Text (widget) for username and Password (widget) for password. Then in the main activity, I've created a func that willl take input and when the button (Log In) will be clicked, then the values from the username and password will be displayed in the "Logcat" or "Run".
