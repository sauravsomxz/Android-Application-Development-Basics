Micro Projects - Here you'll find all the micro projects that I had made while I was learning.

1. Currency Converter - This is a simple Currency Converter That Converts INR (Indian Rupee) to Dollars ($). This is a todo after completing the first 4 apps. You would need to add all the 4 concepts and make this one. I've made a simple one. Feel free to make it more interactive.

2. Higher or Lower game - In this project, I've made a simple Guessing Game where a random number will be generated by Android and the user has to guess the number. Untill the number is same, the user has to keep guessing and once the guess is matches, the correct message will be displayed. The random get's generated at startup so the to replay the game, the user needs to close the game and start again. This is a project which can be done using the basics of Android and Java. So after learning Java and Android, try this! :)
